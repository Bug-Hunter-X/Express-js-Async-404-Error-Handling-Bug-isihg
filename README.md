This repository demonstrates a common bug in Express.js applications related to handling 404 errors when dealing with asynchronous database operations. The bug arises from the fact that the `res.status(404).send()` method is not awaited in the async function, resulting in a potential race condition. The solution shows how to use `await` or promises to properly handle asynchronous operations before responding.
